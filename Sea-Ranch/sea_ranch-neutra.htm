<p><font face="Arial">Some Thoughts About Sea Ranch and the Third Wave Bay Area
Style</font></p>
</b>
<p><font face="Arial">Raymond Richard Neutra 6-23-17</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We recently visited our friends the Linkwitzs in Sea Ranch
and then through them gained access to Charles Moore's condo designed by him and
his partners. They also set up an appointment to talk with architect Lisa Dundee
who staffs the design review board and she in turn set up visits with Maynard
and Lou Lyndon at their house designed by his older brother Donlyn Lyndon. Later
we visited Donlyn and his artist and photographer wife Alice in their house also
designed by Donlyn. Both Maynard and Donlyn had spent time in the 1936 Neutra
Plywood house that their architect father Maynard Sr. had bought for his family
when he moved to California in the early 1940’s .</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Neutra-house-p.jpg" width="616" height="468"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I learned that Al Boeke an architect who had worked with
Neutra and Alexander, probably on the Chavez Ravine public housing community in
Elysian Park, had gone on to work with developer Castle and Cook. On their
behalf he developed 10 miles of coastal sheep ranch into the development called
Sea Ranch. Much of the construction was done by Matthew Sylvia, who allegedly
had been recommended by my father to Boeke because of Matthew’s work on some
of my father’s buildings. It was his experience with simple details that
allowed a good</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">While paying more attention to views than historicist
buildings would, implementation of apparently simple windows being placed
without sills and frames into the planks of walls of those buildings. In fact it
involved careful cutting of planks to fit the standard metal windows that were
used at Sea Ranch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">According to the Design Guidelines provided to me by Lisa
Dundee, the vision of Al Boeke and the team of Halprin, Escherick, Moore, Lyndon
Whitaker et al, matched some but not all of what would have been my father’s
philosophy. As he would have, they wanted to preserve the several ecologies of
the site, they wanted to arrange the dwellings to make use of near and far
vistas, they wanted to be unobtrusive in the landscape and they wanted to have
the various structures and their uses not interfere with each other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">These goals could have been achieved with Neutra style
buildings, Japanese style buildings, FL Wright style buildings, maybe even adobe
style buildings, but not with, mediterranean, McMansions etc. Indeed, the
indigenous Victorian middle class buildings of the north coast would not have
met these goals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The relationship between interior and exterior could have
been done in the Japanese manner or as my father and Maynard Lyndon, (Donlyn’s
father) would have done it, making the landscape the main decorative feature of
the interior.&nbsp;</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p>I<img border="0" src="interior-exterior-p.jpg" width="716" height="541"></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">While paying more attention to views than historicist
buildings would, instead the architects decided that they would elicit
associations with the barn architecture of the region, through external shapes
and use of natural unpainted wood on the exterior. Sometimes the tilted the
horizontal Barn shapes on end to create silo-like shapes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The barns, it was claimed related to the local landscape
and respond to the windy conditions. They recommended shed roofs presenting the
slant to the direction of the prevailing winds from the northwest and to eschew
overhanging eaves so as to avoid, it was claimed, turbulence. The ideological
rationalism of my father’s strain of architecture and my own derivative
epidemiological training, immediately made me ask myself what evidence existed
for the unique fit of the north coast barns to the climate or that eves really
created turbulence or were these assertions poetry dressed as fact.</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p><img border="0" src="condo-a-p.jpg" width="418" height="551"></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Sea Ranch design team were in the tradition of the
modernists in that the cubic and prismatic shapes that characterized their
style, would be seen by most untutored people as unlike anything that had ever
been built and was not literally historicist. Also by having interiors with
heavy posts and beams with angular interior trusses upon which wall planks were
attached, made the interiors look like barn interiors, something that no middle
class person of the 19th century would have tolerated as an interior, but which
projected an image of egalitarian efficiency in that there was at first only a
layer of planks, tarpaper and planks between the residents and the outside.
Subsequently a grid of two by fours was added to the outside of the inner planks
to seat solid insulation and another course of planks were put on the outside.
If one wanted to be brutally efficient and eschew the romance of the barn, I
suppose one could reveal the styrofoam grid to the inside and have only one
course of planks, that for the outside skin. While barns had no frameless metal
windows installed, these dwellings did, and it took great and expensive skill to
make this work without a special wooden frame and sills to seat the
off-the-shelf metal windows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It struck me that this style of prismatic wooden shapes
could be done artfully by people like Charles Moore and Donlyn, or could be
rather pedestrian, but when grouped together they formed rather pleasing
accidental fractal groupings.&nbsp;</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p><img border="0" src="blocks-p.jpg" width="616" height="466"></p>
</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">This might not be so much the case with flat roofs of most
of my father’s houses, although in houses like his 1942 Nesbitt house, he used
shed roofs.</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p><img border="0" src="shed-roof-p.jpg" width="616" height="467"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Under the influence of Lou Kahn and Charles Moore, the
Wrightian idea of freely flowing space, adopted by Neutra and other California
modernists like Maynard Lyndon, was replaced by an interest in creating playful
spaces and lofts sometimes in multi story spaces.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Sky lights allowed the moving sun to cast changing rays of
light that created shadows from the interior posts, beams and angular trusses on
the rough textured planks. Donlyn said that his modernist architect father
Maynard had seen photographs of the interior of Donlyn’s house and commented,
perhaps slightly critically that “there was a lot going on.”</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p><img border="0" src="visitors-p.jpg" width="414" height="545"></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I noticed, that, by creating this informal complex
interior landscape, the architects had provided a setting that was forgiving,
nay welcoming to the nick nicks and possessions of the inhabitants, that would
have read as “clutter” in a spare modernist space.</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p><img border="0" src="clutter-p.jpg" width="619" height="469"></p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">While paying more attention to views than historicist
buildings would, the drama, complexities and fun of view opportunities in the
interior were important as well.</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p><img border="0" src="drama-p.jpg" width="615" height="464"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="drama-2-p.jpg" width="421" height="549"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I asked Lisa and Donlyn what other architectural
approaches were considered compatible with their guidelines. Lisa took us by a
recent house by Millar and Sheine that captured the shape and color palette of
the other houses through the use of concrete and rusted Korten steel.</font></p>
