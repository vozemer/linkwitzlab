  <H3>Stereophile interviews Siegfried Linkwitz</H3>
  <H4>By Shannon Dickson<BR></H4>
  <P>Siegfried Linkwitz was born in Germany in 1935. He received his electrical 
  engineering degree from Darmstadt Technical University prior to moving to 
  California in 1961 to work for Hewlett-Packard. During his early years in the 
  US, he did postgraduate work at Stanford University. For over 30 years Mr. 
  Linkwitz has developed electronic test equipment ranging from signal 
  generators, to network and spectrum analyzers, to microwave sweepers and 
  instrumentation for evaluating electromagnetic compatibility. He has also had 
  a long and distinguished second career as an audio engineering visionary. 
  Along with Russ Riley he developed the famed, and widely used, Linkwitz-Riley 
  crossover filter in the mid-1970s. Since then he has contributed several 
  important technical papers covering a variety of measurement and speaker 
  issues to such publications as the <I>Journal of the Audio Engineering 
  Society</I>, <I>Electronics (Wireless) World</I>, and <I>Speaker 
Build</I>.</P>
  <P>Most recently, he has joined forces with fellow HP engineer Marshall Kay, 
  CAD (computer-aided design) specialist Kurt Pasquale, and marketing consultant 
  Tom Hoffman to form Audio Artistry. This three-year-old, North Carolina-based 
  company is dedicated to developing and crafting speakers based on the 
  accumulated insights and wisdom Mr. Linkwitz has gained over three decades of 
  loudspeaker research. I spoke with Siegfried about some of these insights and 
  experiences during the course of evaluating the Audio Artistry Dvorak, the 
  review of which is found elsewhere in this issue. My first question concerned 
  what had motivated Linkwitz to get involved in audio.</P><B>
  <P>Siegfried Linkwitz:</B> I grew up in a family in which music was very much 
  appreciated. My father and brother played the piano, and although 
  circumstances during World War II prevented me from learning an instrument, 
  I've always had a love for music. After graduating from university and joining 
  Hewlett-Packard to design electronics, it was only natural that I wanted to 
  build audio equipment I could use at home, so I got very involved in building 
  power amplifiers, FM tuners, preamps, and you name it -- anything electronic I 
  needed to reproduce music. Then I had the fortune of meeting some other 
  engineers at HP who were similarly involved in audio, particularly Lyman 
  Miller and Russ Riley. Lyman was very much into electronic design and making 
  recordings while Russ built amplifiers and had a keen interest in speaker 
  development. They really turned me on to investigating things even deeper, and 
  loudspeakers, to us, were the most interesting and challenging area since so 
  little was really understood about them. The speakers then on the market could 
  certainly be improved, so we saw a real chance to make a genuine 
  contribution.</P><B>
  <P>Shannon Dickson:</B> <I>Could you share with us some of the fundamental 
  problems you and your colleagues encountered during the early attempts to 
  improve speaker performance?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> One of the problems at the time was that good test equipment 
  wasn't available to us. Russ Riley developed his real-time 1/3-octave analyzer 
  and a pink noise source which we used to make in-room measurements. I bought 
  an early Advent speaker, measured it using the real-time analyzer, and 
  consequently developed an equalizer to flatten-out its frequency response. 
  That was a first attempt on my part. I then experienced a real surprise after 
  we went to some local stores and heard the Electrostatic Sound System's ESS-7. 
  It just sounded great, much better than the Advent. Naturally, I bought the 
  speaker and took it home, but after measuring it, I was astonished -- it 
  measured very poorly! That led to a whole investigation into why it sounded so 
  good but tested so badly.</P>
  <P>We found out rather quickly how important driver quality was, as well as 
  the distortion contributions of cabinet resonances. We began experimenting 
  with wool stuffing in the box and various bracing and panel damping 
  techniques. We found that wool could be a very effective loading material. A 
  number of commercial designs sounded much better when we replaced whatever 
  they had inside with natural wool fiber. In my early designs, we tried two 
  basic concepts built around rather small enclosures, both of which worked 
  quite well. For instance, we made some very rigid, heavily braced small 
  monitors; then we went the other way, using very limp, thin panels for the box 
  construction. These were very easy to damp by applying roofing tar with sand 
  mixed in. As you can imagine, this was a real messy operation -- it smelled 
  pretty bad too, particularly if you placed the speaker in the sun. It would 
  out-gas for several weeks before you could tolerate the smell!</P>
  <P>While it damped box resonances quite effectively, this approach was not 
  really practical from a commercial point of view, nor would it have been a 
  very welcome addition to most people's living rooms. But it did demonstrate 
  how important minimizing box resonances is and just how difficult it is to 
  really control this form of resonant behavior.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>You've worked with some of the most respected engineers in 
  audio over the years. Who had the greatest impact on your thinking regarding 
  speaker development?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> I mentioned Lyman and Russ already. Lyman was really into the 
  recording side of things, so he did a lot of recordings on a semiprofessional 
  basis and was particularly interested in capturing sounds as close to their 
  natural origin as possible. So we had some great reference material to guide 
  our evaluation. I learned a lot about recording from Lyman and continued to 
  make many of my own reference recordings, which I used extensively during the 
  development of these new speakers. Russ Riley is a very ingenious design 
  engineer and, on top of it, a superb listener. I was always impressed by how 
  easily he could identify just what the problems were in a speaker and in what 
  frequency range and what one needed to do about them. He had absolutely superb 
  hearing. While not as well-known as some of the other engineers, both Lyman 
  and Russ had a big impact on my early audio career.</P>
  <P>Through my work in developing test equipment for Hewlett-Packard, I met 
  Laurie Fincham [then with KEF, now with Infinity] and we became good friends. 
  We've shared a vast amount of information with each other over the years, have 
  met frequently, and consequently had some very positive mutual influence on 
  one another. Through Laurie, I was also introduced to a number of 
  distinguished engineers such as Floyd Toole, Stan Lipshitz, John Vanderkooy, 
  and Peter Walker from Quad. I had been following all of these people's 
  writings very intensely all along, so it was a joy to meet them.</P>
  <P>Most of these folks have been at my house at one time or another to listen 
  to various ideas I had been working on. In addition, I have been an avid 
  reader of the<I> JAES</I> throughout the years, as well as <I>Wireless 
  World</I> from the UK [<I>now</I> Electronics World -- <I>Ed</I>.]. 
  <I>Wireless World</I> used to carry a great deal of high-quality information 
  about audio and speakers; it still does, in fact, though it's not as easy to 
  find these days. Actually, my first publication appeared in 1978 as a lengthy 
  three-part article in <I>Wireless</I> <I>World</I> in which I described the 
  construction of a three-way active speaker system consisting of small 
  satellites and a subwoofer.</P>
  <P>In summary, the various influences on my thinking have led to a general 
  approach that is really a blend of the analytical -- meaning the measurement 
  of things -- and the subjective listening experience, to try to find out what 
  is really going on. If there is a hypothesis of why something works -- this 
  way or that -- I'll set up an experiment to see if I can prove it or disprove 
  it. In this way, I've always attempted to correlate what we hear with 
  objective measurements -- not always successfully, mind you, but at least 
  making the connection where possible. This method will give you a lot of 
  insight into which measurement or artifacts are important and which are not so 
  important. Occasionally, I've found results that look very significant on 
  paper but are barely perceptible, if at all, while on the other hand, some 
  extremely slight irregularities can by very important sonically.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>Can you tell us what your priorities are in making and 
  evaluating specific measurements?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> I've learned there is a whole battery of measurements one 
  needs to use -- and interpret correctly -- in order to get a better picture of 
  any given speaker. No one measurement will tell you the whole story. At the 
  top of the list is definitely a loudspeaker's on-axis anechoic 
  frequency-response measurement because this represents the direct sound you 
  hear. However, of similar importance are the vertical and horizontal anechoic 
  off-axis responses. So in my designs, I try to achieve a very well-behaved 
  off-axis response which duplicates the shape of that on-axis, but steadily 
  decreases in level the farther you move off-axis. This is so important in 
  determining the reverberant field and the reflected sound in the listening 
  room.</P>
  <P>Another key factor I learned during the development of my crossover design 
  is that, when two drivers are combined in the crossover region, their summed 
  output should be at its maximum on-axis. In other words, the radiation pattern 
  remains stable at the crossover region and doesn't shift. For example, I've 
  found through experimentation that it is definitely audible if you go some 
  distance above-axis and all of a sudden have a maximum peak or sharp dip in 
  the crossover region. This problem is similar to what happens with many 
  large-panel dipole designs. As they produce higher frequencies, their off-axis 
  response becomes more irregular, with peaks and valleys that can color the 
  overall sound and make speaker placement in a given room very critical. If the 
  crossover on any speaker doesn't blend together, you can get this kind of 
  off-axis peak.</P>
  <P>Another measurement I look at is the overall frequency response on a 
  half-octave or octave basis, just to see the general trend: whether the treble 
  is rising or sloping, etc. When you look at any response in detail, you never 
  get a flat picture, you always have little ups and downs; but I've found you 
  don't really gain anything by trying to smooth out these small ripple effects 
  in the response. However, how smooth the response is over a third- or 
  half-octave basis is important. I'm essentially looking for an averaged-flat 
  anechoic response.</P>
  <P>I do my quasi-anechoic measurements outdoors, with the speakers mounted on 
  a 50" turntable so that the speaker is as far away from any reflecting 
  surfaces as possible, yet still manageable. I try to get 10 milliseconds of 
  undisturbed sound between the initial impulse response and the arrival of the 
  first reflection, which will give me a frequency resolution of 100Hz and 
  useful data for all frequencies above a couple of hundred Hertz. I also try to 
  minimize the first reflection off the floor or ground with acoustic absorbers. 
  But as you can see, this method really doesn't tell you much about the 
  bass.</P>
  <P>After my series of anechoic tests, I perform in-room measurements over a 
  50ms time window. This gives me a frequency resolution of 20Hz, and since 50ms 
  is a pretty long time in a room, it does take into account the room 
  reflections. I also use 50ms because that is about the maximum time span 
  [during which] the human brain can process the characteristics of a sonic 
  event. Basically, I use these in-room measurements as confirmation of the 
  anechoic results, not to correct for all the reflection anomalies or peaks and 
  dips that show up in the response. I do, however, make these in-room tests 
  from several different locations, and with our new dipole designs, even these 
  in-room measurements over a long time window are surprisingly smooth and 
  flat.</P>
  <P>Another test I perform looks for resonances and stored energy in various 
  locations -- using a Shaped Tone Burst stimulus, which is particularly 
  well-suited for this. This is a <I>tremendous</I> test signal. I measure the 
  impedance curve of the drivers themselves to reveal driver anomalies, and I 
  also use complex multi-tone signals to test for nonlinear intermodulation 
  distortion artifacts.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>This is essentially the spectral contamination distortion 
  measurement you are speaking of?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> Yes, exactly, the same concept, in order to find nonlinear 
  problems. Interestingly, in the old days when we used pink noise as the 
  stimulus to try to equalize a speaker to be flat at the listening position in 
  a real room, it typically turned out too bright-sounding. This is an approach 
  that may be useful in a PA setup, but in a listening room it doesn't lead to a 
  correct result.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>Tell us more about the Shaped Tone Burst test you just 
  referred to. I found your article in the April 1980 issue of the </I>JAES<I> 
  (Vol.28 No.2), discussing the benefits of using this stimulus in speaker 
  evaluation, very interesting.</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> From a practical standpoint, the advantage of using a shaped 
  tone burst (one that rises and decays gradually in a sinusoidal envelope) is 
  that all of the burst energy is concentrated into a very narrow frequency 
  band. This is quite different from tone bursts used in the past, where you had 
  a rectangular burst covering a fairly wide frequency band. I chose a spectrum 
  width of a third of an octave for this stimulus -- which is a 5-cycle burst -- 
  because this corresponds closely to how we hear. A third-octave is about the 
  width of the critical band of hearing. Also, because the burst is so short in 
  duration, you mask out the effect of reflections, so it becomes a sort of poor 
  man's approach to anechoic measurements. As long as you measure the peak of 
  the burst before the first reflection, you've essentially captured an 
  anechoic-like response giving you some of the benefits of Time Delay 
  Spectrometry or Maximum Length Sequence (MLSSA) techniques without the 
  expense.</P>
  <P>Now, the shaped tone burst can be used in several ways. For instance, one 
  can just use a microphone to measure the peak amplitude that the burst reaches 
  after you apply it to a speaker, which will give you an approximation of the 
  frequency response. Likewise, after the decay of the 5-cycle burst, there 
  shouldn't be any output from the speaker. In reality, however, if there is 
  stored energy in the drivers or cabinet, the speaker keeps on ringing. 
  Therefore, the shaped tone burst is very useful for identifying the sources of 
  resonant storage. In any event, I do get extremely good correlation between 
  the frequency-response measurements derived from the shaped tone-burst test 
  and what we hear, as well as specific information about cabinet and driver 
  resonances.</P>
  <P>The real benefit of this type of test is that it concentrates the energy 
  into a constant narrow frequency band so that it is a third-octave in width at 
  100Hz or 1kHz or 10kHz. Therefore, it is much narrower on an absolute basis at 
  100Hz than at, say, 10kHz. In other words, the tone-burst test has a constant 
  resolution on an octave basis. This is important when you compare it to FFT 
  analysis, where you get good resolution at high frequencies but very little 
  information at low frequencies. The shaped tone-burst test works on a 
  logarithmic scale so we can get good resolution all the way down to the lowest 
  frequencies. I use the type of test signal to look at the decay of the burst, 
  which gives me the same type of information that you would be looking for in a 
  spectral-decay or waterfall plot that MLSSA can generate.</P>
  <P>I also have MLSSA, so I do generate the spectral-decay plots as well, but I 
  have to say, I have not found the waterfall plots very useful except for maybe 
  above 1kHz. Below 1kHz there are so many artifacts in the typical 
  spectral-decay waterfall plot that it is useless. Anyway, it's simply a lot 
  easier to get the same, and even much more, information out of the shaped 
  tone-burst response. Extending the time record for the FFT in order to get 
  useful low-frequency data is generally not practical; using a narrow burst 
  signal makes it so direct and easy. Plus, you change the frequency of the tone 
  burst on the fly, while you watch the dynamic changes on a oscilloscope, as 
  the tail of the burst stretches out -- in effect allowing you to see directly 
  when you're close to a resonance!</P>
  <P>I guess I'm beginning to sound a little like a missionary for the shaped 
  tone-burst test, but I really do believe it is an extremely powerful technique 
  that is too infrequently employed. Many people are just not aware of how it 
  differs from traditional tone-burst stimuli. Today it is particularly easy to 
  generate the required burst signals since you can buy an arbitrary waveform 
  generator fairly inexpensively. Also, it would be very easy to include a 
  series of 5-cycle-wide bursts at various frequencies on a test CD; then, with 
  an oscilloscope or perhaps one of the PC-based softward test systems, the 
  audiophile would be equipped with a powerful tool for evaluating his system 
  and speakers.</P>
  <P>One final attribute of the shaped tone burst that I find very important is 
  that it's a particularly safe signal with which to test the maximum output of 
  components. For instance, if you use a burst rate of 1Hz with a 5-cycle burst 
  you'll have a very low duty-cycle, so even if you require 100 watts to clip 
  your tweeter, the short duration of the burst -- it's essentially like a 
  frequency specific pulse -- will prevent you from overheating the voice-coil 
  and damaging the driver.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>You're most widely known as the developer of the 
  Linkwitz-Riley crossover. Could you explain a few of the characteristics of 
  this crossover?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> To answer your question, we need to go back to when I started 
  out exploring the whole speaker issue in the early '70s. Then you could take 
  the grille-clothe off many of the available speakers and see a strange, almost 
  haphazard arrangement of the drivers on the baffle. It really puzzled me and I 
  wondered what was going on. So I asked some of the designers why they were 
  doing this and they said, "Because we've found it sounds better."</P>
  <P>As I looked further into this issue, I realized that two principal things 
  were not well-understood. First, very little was known at that time about the 
  effects of diffraction from the cabinet edges. Second, and more importantly, 
  very little was understood about how phase-shift with respect to the current 
  passing through the voice-coils of different drivers affected the polar 
  radiation pattern of a speaker. In other words, the interaction between the 
  electrical side of a driver and the acoustical response was not clear at the 
  time. For example, the phase-shift between the current in the tweeter and 
  midrange voice-coils, relative to the placement of these drivers on the 
  baffle, affects the speaker's radiation pattern.</P>
  <P>Basically, since few drivers are really coaxial, with the difference in 
  physical placement -- that is, if the path lengths between the drivers and the 
  listening point are different, or even if they are the same -- you get a 
  vector addition which is a function of the phase-shift between the different 
  voice-coil currents and the distance between each driver and the listener. So 
  Russ Riley and I began our work, in earnest, to be sure that the drivers were 
  in-phase in the crossover region. This, in essence, is what the Linkwitz-Riley 
  crossover is all about; making sure that you have the same acoustic phase 
  between the midrange/woofer and the tweeter at the crossover.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B><I> How about the phase relationship outside of the crossover 
  region?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> As it turns out, that same phase relationship is maintained 
  at other frequencies as well. This is very much in contrast to the classical 
  Butterworth crossovers that people use in a number of speakers. An inherent 
  property of the Butterworth design, whether these are first-order, 
  third-order, fifth-order, etc., is that the crossovers are always in phase 
  quadrature. In other words, the acoustical signals coming from the midrange 
  and tweeter are phase-shifted by 90<SUP>o</SUP> relative to each other. At its 
  -3dB point, each driver has an amplitude of 0.7, and if you add two 
  90<SUP>o</SUP> phase-shifted vectors of 0.7, you get unity -- the outputs of 
  the two drivers add to unity on-axis. However, as you move farther away 
  off-axis, one or the other driver will experience more phase-shift as the 
  path-length difference becomes longer, and you'll have either a dip or a peak 
  in the amplitude response off-axis.</P>
  <P>In any event, the true maximum output of the two drivers will occur 
  someplace off-axis, and this is an audibly bad thing. The peak off-axis 
  response can then reflect from the nearest boundary and combine with the 
  direct sound as added coloration.</P>
  <P>Now, a first-order crossover can be made phase-perfect at one point in 
  space, but I feel quite strongly that you cannot just look at a speaker's 
  performance at one single point in space. The off-axis response is also very 
  important to a speaker's overall performance in a real room, because the 
  radiation in these other directions will add, through reflected and 
  reverberant interactions, to what you hear. Typically, we don't listen to 
  speakers outdoors or in anechoic chambers.</P>
  <P>For an ideal Linkwitz-Riley crossover, the amplitude is flat on-axis or at 
  unity, just as it would be for an ideal Butterworth. However, the Butterworth 
  response will have its peak off-axis. In contrast, the amplitude of the L-R 
  crossover will be down in level off-axis, and will never be higher than the 
  on-axis response. The crossover point of a Linkwitz-Riley will also be at the 
  -6dB point, equivalent to an amplitude of 0.5, and only when you add vectors 
  with amplitudes of 0.5 that are in-phase will you get unity. If there is any 
  phase angle between these half-amplitude vectors, their sum will be less than 
  unity.</P>
  <P>A very important point that people sometimes miss in this discussion is 
  that when we are speaking of a given crossover, we are talking about an 
  <I>acoustic </I>crossover, or what happens acoustically. Now, what I have to 
  do electrically to achieve the correct acoustic response may not look anything 
  at all like a textbook filter design. The actual filter often looks very 
  little like the drawings I may show to explain any given example. This is also 
  true for a Butterworth filter. It is highly unlikely that a textbook 
  electrical Butterworth crossover will produce an acoustic Butterworth 
  response, because the driver's response enters into the picture as 
well.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>There is a general misconception in some circles about 
  differential vs absolute phase effects in speakers. Recently, I've heard about 
  some well-meaning but misinformed retailers who arbitrarily reverse the 
  polarity of either the tweeter or midrange hookup wires in all of the speakers 
  they sell that are designed with high-order crossovers, in an attempt to make 
  them "in-phase" -- much to the horror of the original designer. Perhaps you 
  could shed some light on this issue.</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> If someone were to arbitrarily change the polarity between 
  drivers in a good Linkwitz-Riley crossover, they should get a strong null at 
  the crossover point on-axis. In fact, this is a test I use to see how well I 
  have executed the acoustic crossover. However, making such a change with the 
  idea of somehow making a "phase-coherent" speaker is not correct. It will 
  certainly change the sound, mind you, but is definitely not 
recommended.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>The Dvorak and Vivaldi speakers represent a radical 
  departure from your earlier philosophy. What inspired this change in 
  direction, and could you outline some of the primary goals you've tried to 
  achieve with these new dynamic dipole designs?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> I would have to say the departure in my thinking happened by 
  coincidence. At the time, I had volunteered to build a public address system 
  to improve speech and sound intelligibility for a video production in a large, 
  highly reverberant gymnasium. I designed a long directional column speaker 
  with multiple 6" dynamic drivers firing as dipoles. In other words, the back 
  of the column's baffle was open so the sound radiated to the front and rear 
  with each direction out of phase with the other. The directivity of the 
  radiation pattern of this design worked really well in this very reverberant 
  environment. You could understand what was said just as well from the back of 
  the hall as from the front. Well, just for kicks, I took the thing home, split 
  this long column into two shorter stereo columns, and decided to see how it 
  sounded in my living room. I was really surprised to hear that it had some of 
  the qualities that impressed me so much with other dipole speakers, like the 
  Quad electrostatics. Not that these PA speakers were anywhere close in tonal 
  balance or transparency, but there was something fundamental about the 
  character and quality that reminded me of these better dipoles.</P>
  <P>In any event, that got me started on investigating the possibilities of 
  using conventional high-quality dynamic drivers as dipoles. Quite frankly, 
  I've always been very fond of certain characteristics that some electrostatic 
  dipoles posses, yet I had never seriously pursued panel dipoles, in spite of 
  their good qualities, because there was not enough dynamic low-frequency 
  output for me. They also had a very tight listening spot, and were generally 
  just too limited in what they could do.</P>
  <P>Based on my initial experience with the PA columns, I set out to build a 
  speaker that could perform similar to an electrostatic dipole but using 
  conventional dynamic drivers in a manner that would avoid some of the 
  limitations faced by large panel designs. It took several evolutionary 
  iterations of the design to get a good understanding of which aspects of 
  dipole operation are really important and which are not so critical, and why 
  this is so.</P>
  <P>During this development phase, I discovered how important the baffle shape 
  and design were, as well as the frequency range over which dipole radiation 
  was most beneficial. For instance, I found that dipole radiation of the treble 
  region was not only unnecessary but, in fact, a disadvantage. Interestingly, 
  you don't even see the rear-firing response from a dipole tweeter when you 
  measure it on-axis, but when I listened to it in the room, I found that it 
  caused some high-frequency "splatter" that didn't seem natural. I abandoned 
  that approach and used a monopole dome tweeter from 2kHz on up and dipole 
  radiation from the cone drivers down to 20Hz. I started out with a completely 
  active system, with separate amps for all drivers, and used equalization as 
  well. I equalized the speaker to be flat since a dipole on a small baffle has 
  this natural 6dB/octave rolloff below a certain point. This first version was 
  a pretty elaborate prototype.</P>
  <P>Actually, at first I used a closed-box woofer because I didn't think I 
  could get enough bass output from a compact dipole woofer system with a 
  reasonable number of drivers. This is because of the acoustic short-circuit 
  between front and back that a dipole represents. However, after sharing notes 
  with Brian Elliott, a good friend and acoustician who had developed a splendid 
  dipole bass system using six 12" drivers per channel, I began looking at the 
  possibilities for dipole bass more closely. His system simply produced the 
  most astoundingly natural low-frequency reproduction I had ever heard. 
  However, I still stayed with the closed-box woofer concept a while longer. 
  Then Don Barringer, another good friend and the recording engineer for the US 
  Marine Band, reported great results in a normal-sized listening room using a 
  speaker based on my design, but extending the dipole operation into the bass 
  with two 12" drivers per channel equalized flat.</P>
  <P>So, while I was refining the dipole midrange/monopole tweeter parameters of 
  my speakers, I was actually a latecomer in taking the dipole concept all the 
  way. As it turns out, and somewhat surprisingly to me, two big dipole woofers 
  per channel does a very respectable job. Not quite like Brian's system with 
  its total of twelve 12" drivers, but actually very good. On the other hand, 
  we've also learned that there is very little difference between four and six 
  12" woofers per side, and with some creative mounting techniques, we've been 
  able to mount four large drivers in a surprisingly compact dipole enclosure 
  for use in larger rooms, and as a standard feature in our new top-of-the-line 
  speaker system, the Beethoven.</P>
  <P>Anyway, the production Dvorak is a five-piece, actively bi-amplified system 
  comprising two main panels, two separate subwoofer cabinets, and an active 
  crossover/equalizer. It covers the full audible range and beyond, from 10Hz to 
  25kHz. If a person has a small room or doesn't require deep bass below 40Hz, 
  they can just use the main panel with a single amplifier, but the active 
  crossover/equalizer is still required for the EQ of the two mid/bass drivers. 
  We have also recently released the Vivaldi speaker, which has the same driver 
  complement as the full Dvorak system but all mounted in one tall speaker. The 
  system uses a passive design for both the crossover and equalization so it has 
  a reasonable flat response to about 40Hz, below which the dipole's natural 
  rolloff occurs. This system is ideal for those in small- to moderate-sized 
  rooms who don't need the full 20Hz extension of the complete Dvorak system. It 
  also requires just a single stereo amplifier.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>I suppose the directivity of the Dvoraks, particularly with 
  the separate dipole subwoofers, presents some special considerations when 
  these speakers are measured.</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> One of the real problems was: How do you measure a dynamic 
  dipole accurately? For instance, you cannot measure close to the cone because 
  then you'll only see what the cone does essentially. You will not get the 
  effect of the cancellation when the negative-polarity rear wave combines with 
  the forward positive wave, so you have to measure some distance away. That 
  really forces you into either an outdoor or anechoic-type measurement. It's 
  very important to do it this way to get meaningful results. If the cabinet is 
  large, or if the drivers are spaced very far apart, you have to have a least 
  the same distance to your measurement microphone in order to capture the 
  integrated sound coming from the rear, or off the edges of the cabinet, etc. 
  The separate subwoofers are quite tricky to measure as well.</P>
  <P>The bottom line on the Dvorak is that everything is based on a flat 
  response under anechoic conditions with a moderately directional radiation 
  throughout its full range. When I say that the dipole aspects of the speakers 
  are directional, it's not in a very strong sense. For instance, the response 
  is 1dB down at 30<SUP>o</SUP> off-axis, 3dB down 45<SUP>o</SUP> off-axis, 6dB 
  down at 60<SUP>o</SUP>, and has a null around 90<SUP>o</SUP>. The monopole 
  tweeter also maintains a similar directional characteristic because of the 
  baffle design and the wavelengths of its frequency band. Of course, it differs 
  from the dipole drivers in that it fires predominantly forward. The important 
  thing is that the shape of the off-axis room response is very consistent with 
  that produced on-axis, resulting in the open-sounding soundstage and the 
  speaker's even tonal characteristics. Also the dipole "figure-8" cosine 
  directionality goes all the way from 2kHz down through the woofer's range to 
  20Hz. This directional deep bass is really pretty amazing! If you have another 
  person to help you, play some low-frequency tones, then have your friend 
  rotate the woofer cabinet and you can clearly hear the output null at 
  90<SUP>o</SUP> off-axis!</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>Yes, I've noticed I can hear increased focus in the low 
  bass when I toe-in the woofers. This is one speaker where "stereo" bass may 
  have some real meaning. Two of the Dvorak's sonic characteristics I find most 
  striking are its dramatic reduction of room-induced colorations from the low 
  bass through the midrange, and its ability to convey image height in correct 
  proportion to the width and depth dimension of the soundfield. What factors do 
  you think contribute most to the effects?</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> These are primarily due to the dipole characteristics and the 
  even room response. Since the speaker is moderately directional at all 
  frequencies, more of the sound is directed toward the listener and less to the 
  walls and ceiling. Therefore, less comes back from the room in the form of 
  resonances or reverberation which will blend with and color the direct sound 
  from the speaker.... The active equalization is merely there to correct for 
  the dipole cancellation that the raw drivers would have if you didn't 
  compensate for the inherent 6dB/octave rolloff.</P>
  <P>Now the image height is an interesting thing. I have to state that I don't 
  fully understand all the psychoacoustics involved here, but I have found that 
  it is important that the center of the radiating elements be at about ear 
  height, and that the speakers have some vertical extension as well. I have 
  built many small two-way minimonitors; while these systems can have very nice 
  horizontal dispersion and excellent imaging, I've always felt that I was 
  listening through a horizontal window, one that was very wide but with a 
  height not much greater than that of the speaker itself. It's like listening 
  through a horizontal sliver. Now vertically spreading out the driver's 
  arrangement expands the vertical dimension of the soundstage and adds much 
  more realism for me.</P>
  <P>With respect to the reduction in overall room colorations that the Dvoraks 
  provide, that has a lot to do with how the dipole characteristics are 
  implemented. This comes back to the fact that the off-axis response is very 
  well-behaved in this system. In other words, the design concentrates just as 
  much on the off-axis performance as on the on-axis. While I don't have any 
  definite proof, I strongly suspect that the erratic off-axis behavior of most 
  panel speakers is what makes their room placement so critical, forcing a 
  person to locate the panels in a place that minimizes reflections and changes 
  how the off-axis sound couples with the room, in order to get a balanced 
  output. On the other hand, quite frankly, I have not found the performance of 
  either the Dvorak or the Vivaldi to be critically dependent on room placement 
  compared to other speakers. There is still definitely an optimal placement in 
  any given room, but you can get very satisfactory performance in a wide 
  variety of locations, so this experience lends further credence to the value 
  of a well-behaved off-axis response.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>While the Dvorak and Vivaldi represent a somewhat fresh 
  approach to speaker design, they are mature designs. I'm very curious to hear 
  about what projects you have planned for the near and more distant 
  future.</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> Recently, I've been doing extensive investigations into 
  numerous drivers using some of the newly developed measurement techniques I 
  alluded to earlier -- especially the tests for nonlinear distortion artifacts, 
  and those that help locate and define energy-storage effects in drivers 
  themselves. All this in a search for components that have even more clarity 
  and transparency. What I had in mind was to see how much further this Dvorak 
  concept could be refined.</P>
  <P>We unveiled our new flagship, the Beethoven, at the recently completed '96 
  WCES in Las Vegas. In addition to an all-new balanced electronic crossover, 
  each main panel has a new silk-dome tweeter, two new 8" drivers, and a pair of 
  10" dipole drivers -- all low-distortion, high-excursion models. Both of the 
  woofer cabinets for the new system contain four 12" dipole drivers, so 
  obviously this system is designed for high-output, very-low-distortion sound 
  and will be considerably more expensive than the standard Dvorak. I must say 
  we have been extremely gratified with the performance of the new system. So 
  that's one project we are putting the finishing touches on now, and we are 
  also thinking about a smaller, lower-cost version of a dipole speaker in the 
  future.</P>
  <P>A little farther down the road, possibly over the next few years, I would 
  also like to settle in my mind the importance of what I would describe as 
  "linear phase." This refers to obtaining a result that is a more accurate 
  replica of the time-do-main wavefront. Some people seem to think that this is 
  very important for reproducing clicks and transient-type sounds, and that may 
  well be. From a common-sense point of view, it seems logical that you would 
  want to have a true replication of the wavefront.</P>
  <P>However, I'm not totally convinced because I have done a lot of experiments 
  with phase-distorted signals. Basically, I've shifted the phase between 
  different spectral components by running various signals through an "all-pass" 
  filter, where the amplitude is unaffected when I change the phase response 
  with frequency. When you look at these signals on a oscilloscope and change 
  the phase, they look grossly different, so you'd think "surely this 
  <I>must</I> sound different." But when you listen, you can't hear the 
  difference, even though the time-domain waveform staring you in the eye looks 
  so totally altered!</P>
  <P>I did quite an investigation into this when I initially developed the 
  Linkwitz-Riley crossover because it is not a linear-phase system -- nor are 
  the Butterworth crossovers, for that matter, except for the first-order slope. 
  The experiments I've done so far have not convinced me that phase distortion 
  in small amounts is audible. Now if the phase distortion is gross, you can 
  definitely hear it, but the typical crossover is far from producing that much 
  phase distortion. However, some people whom I respect seem to think this is 
  something that could have audible consequences, so I'm keeping an open mind 
  about it and want to determine once and for all its value, if I can. I must 
  say that I have not heard an example of a speaker design that conclusively 
  demonstrates the benefit of a linear-phase system.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>I imagine when you look at the total performance of a 
  speaker with the various tradeoffs required to achieve a certain goal, you 
  have to weigh their relative merits.</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> This is true. You could question, for example, whether the 
  extra stress on drivers and resulting distortions produced by a first-order 
  system are not more audibly significant than the subtle improvements 
  potentially created by its linear phase effects. However, it is possible, 
  using digital techniques, to correct for the phase response as well, and my 
  friend, Malcolm Omar Hawksford [of England's Essex University], who has done 
  quite a bit of work in this area, has kindly offered to perform a phase 
  correction for the first 10ms time record of the Dvorak's impulse response 
  with his digital processor. It certainly would require a bit of horsepower to 
  implement digital phase correction in the active crossover, but it could be 
  done.</P>
  <P>Again, it's not yet completely clear whether a digital crossover will buy 
  you anything. It <I>may</I> buy something, and that's the part I'm interested 
  in. For instance, with this scenario we could combine the excellent on- and 
  off-axis amplitude response of the existing Linkwitz-Riley crossover in the 
  Dvorak with an after-the-fact digital correction of the time-domain, to 
  achieve a linear-phase system. You see, the digital time-domain correction 
  would not affect the existing passive or active crossover response at all, it 
  just would correct overall phase. As a matter of fact, at a recent AES 
  convention, both Malcolm Hawksford and I attended a discussion about the use 
  of a very steep crossover filters with digital phase correction. Convincing 
  arguments were presented showing that these extremely steep filters produce 
  sonic anomalies, and consequently are not desirable. Malcolm also stated that 
  something like the Linkwitz-Riley fourth-order crossover was about optimum, 
  even digitally implemented, when phase correction is applied. Anyway, I'm very 
  interested to see how this research turns out.</P><B>
  <P>Dickson:</B> <I>With the continual improvement in driver technology and 
  refinements in other area of audio design, it may be that these more subtle 
  issues, like linear phase, will become more important in the 
future.</P></I><B>
  <P>Linkwitz:</B> I think that's a good way to look at it. You could say that 
  you need to have a certain number of other things done correctly first before 
  those effects come into play. I should also point out that the digital phase 
  compensation I'm speaking of is very different from the digital 
  room-correction systems you may have read about. In any event, these are a few 
  of the areas that we at Audio Artistry look forward to investigating and 
  developing in the near future.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;<!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
